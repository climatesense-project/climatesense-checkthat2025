1. **Identify the Mechanism:** Use precise terms like ""alert detection mechanism"" to specify how the brain detects threats.
2. **Time Frame:** Include details such as ""within milliseconds"" for clarity and specificity.
3. **Process Description:** Employ scientific terminology like ""neuroadaptive process"" to describe memory preservation mechanisms.
4. **Outcome Clarity:** State that memories are purged during consolidation, explaining the process's role in erasing irrelevant information.

The conflict, which involved both Argentina and Britain, underscores the delicate balance of power dynamics influenced by historical legacies, including colonisation. While Indoctrination played a role in fueling tensions, it does not define the broader geopolitical calculus at play.

"Cycling remains one of humanity's most environmentally sustainable and health-promoting modes of transportation. Its safety is underscored by its intuitive infrastructure that minimizes barriers for users while reducing emissions compared to motorized alternatives. However, the reliance on vehicles often prioritizes convenience over safety, contributing significantly to air pollution and energy consumption through their inefficient design.

To further enhance cycling's role in urban environments, equitable access must be ensured for all individuals regardless of ability or means. Addressing these gaps will not only mitigate existing risks but also expand the benefits cycling offers to society at large.

This study highlights the importance of prioritizing cycling infrastructure alongside sustainable mobility solutions to create a safer and more inclusive transportation ecosystem.
